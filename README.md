### Degree Requirements

- **Program-Specific Degree Requirements**
  - **ECON 1101 Macroeconomics**
    - Fundamental economic ideas and the operation of the economy on a national scale. Production, distribution and consumption of goods and services, the exchange process, the role of government, the national income and its distribution, GDP, consumption function, savings function, investment spending, the multiplier principle and the infuence of government spending on income and output. Analysis of monetary policy including the banking system and the Federal Reserve System. 
  - **PHYS 1441 General Physics I: Calculus Based**
    - Basic concepts and principles of mechanics, heat and mechanical waves. Topics include: kinematics, dynamics, statics, work and energy, rotational motion, oscillations and wave motion, fuids, temperature, heat and concepts of thermodynamics. Calculus and vector methods are used throughout the course. Laboratory experiments are computer-based and illustrate and supplement the lecture material.
  - **MAT 1372 Statistics with Probability**
    - Topics include sample spaces and probabilities, discrete probability distributions (Binomial, Hypergeometric), expectation and variance, continuous probability distributions (Normal, Student, Chi-Square), confdence intervals, hypothesis testing, and correlation and regression. Spreadsheets are used throughout the semester. 
  - **MAT 2580 Introduction to Linear Algebra**
    - An introductory course in Linear Algebra. Topics include vectors, vector spaces, systems of linear equations, linear transformations, properties of matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
  - **CST 1101 Problem Solving with Computer Programming**
    - Introduces concepts of problem solving using constructs of logic inherent in computer programming languages. Augmented by high level computer tools, enabling solutions to common algorithmic problems. Use of fowcharts to diagram problem solutions. Object oriented packages, fowcharting tools and viewing generated software code. 
  - **MAT 1575 Calculus II**
    - A continuation of MAT 1475. Topics include Taylor polynomials, Mean Value Theorem, Taylor and Maclaurin series, tests of convergence, techniques of integration, improper integrals, areas, volumes and arclength. 
  - **MAT 2440 Discrete Structures and Algorithms I**
    - This course introduces the foundations of discrete mathematics as they apply to computer science, focusing on providing a solid theoretical foundation for further work. Topics include functions, relations, sets, simple proof techniques, Boolean algebra, propositional logic, elementary number theory, writing, analyzing and testing algorithms. 
  - **MAT 2540 Discrete Structures and Algorithms II**
    - This course continues the discussion of discrete mathematical structures and algorithms introduced in MAT 2440. Topics in the second course include predicate logic, recurrence relations, graphs, trees, digital logic, computational complexity and elementary computability. 
  - **CST 2403 Introductory C++ Programming I**
    - This course is an intensive introduction to computer programming intended for CIS majors. Initial topics include the implementation in the C++ language of data types, operations, expressions, decision statements and loops. Other topics include functions and subprogram structure, pointers, arrays and structures. The course will teach the fundamental programming assignments aimed at reinforcing the material covered in class. 
  - **CST 3503 C++ Programming II**
    - This course is an intensive description of object-oriented programming intended for BTech majors. Central to this object orientation is the concept of a class, which is a programmerdefned data type. Initial topics include implementation in the C++ language. The construction of class is based on both structures and functions, member functions, friend functions, operator overloading. Other topics include inheritance, virtual functions and polymorphism and class templates.

- **Electives**
  - **CST 1204 Database Systems**
    - This course will introduce the student to ANSI standard Structured Query Language (SQL). The course will cover the various syntax that governs this language. In-depth discussions and practice will be given so that the student will be able to manipulate (insert, update, delete and retrieve) data in a relational database. 
  - **MAT 2630 Applied Mathematics Technology- Numerical Methods**
    - An introduction to solving mathematical problems on the computer using a symbolic algebra program with applications drawn from science and engineering. Topics include roots of non-linear functions, interpolation, numerical differentiation and numerical integration. 
  - **PHYS 1442 General Physics II: Calculus Based**
    - A continuation of PHYS 1441. Electricity and magnetism, optics and elements of modern physics. Topics include: electrostatics, electric current and electric circuits, magnetism, electromagnetic induction, alternating current circuits, electromagnetic waves, geometric optics, optical instruments, spectra and physical optics. Calculus and vector methods are used throughout the course. Laboratory experiments are computer-based and illustrate and supplement the lecture material.

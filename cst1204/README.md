### CST 1204 Database Systems

**Instructor Information:**

- Oleg Raginskiy

#### Course Description

This course introduces students to the role and place of databases in Information Systems (IS). The course explains the advantages of databases compared to file systems, describes the basic functionality of the Database Management Systems (DBMS)—the special software needed for running a database, and shows how a database functions with other parts of the IS. 

The course concentrates on relational databases (RDB), explains the organization of data within tables in the RDB and the role of the integrity constraints: the primary and foreign keys. 

The major portion of the course is concerned with Structured Query Language (SQL)—the language of creating and supporting RDBs, and manipulating the relational data. The students learn how to create tables, specify constraints, populate tables with data, and manipulate the data: create, update, delete, and retrieve the data.

Demonstrations of database concepts and practical work performed in one of the relational DBMSs. This will include the creation of tables, manipulation of data in the tables, queries using one or more tables, and importing/exporting data to other applications.

#### Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:

1. Understand the role of a database in an IS, and the relationships databases have with other parts of the IS.
2. Understand the organization of the data in the RDB, the concepts of the table structure, the primary and the foreign keys.
3. Create tables according to a given design, including choosing data types for columns and declaring the column and the table constraints (primary key, foreign key, NOT NULL, CHECK). 
4. Populate tables with data and manipulate the data (create, update, delete and retrieve).
5. Program data retrieval queries, including:
  a. Select data from one table for various retrieval conditions.
  b. Select data from several tables with the help of joins or subqueries, and for various retrieval conditions.
  c. Perform aggregate calculations on data from one or several tables.
